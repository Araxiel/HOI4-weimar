# Weimar

> [!NOTE]
> **26/09/24**: This was an extremely early attempt at an alternativ history start for Germany. I stopped working on this very quickly, and then more alternative history paths got introduced into vanilla, and then there are also mods like Kaiserreich that allow more alt-history 1936 start, so ever continuing this felt pointless.
